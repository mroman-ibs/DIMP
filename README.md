# DIMP

These are the source files for the imputation method for fuzzy data
based on the resampling d-method (see (Romaniuk and Hryniewicz 2019,
2021)). Please note that they are part of the algorithm described in the
paper submitted for review. It is necessary to install two R libraries
*FuzzyNumbers* and *FuzzySimRes* and then evaluate the functions in .R
files before their use. The main function *ImputationDMethod* imputes
missing values (NAs) in the given matrix related to fuzzy numbers. The
respective example together with checking the quality of the output can
be found in the file *example.R*.
