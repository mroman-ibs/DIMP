# DIMP

These are the source files for the imputation method for fuzzy data based on the resampling d-method (see [@romaniuk_hryniewicz;@8920048]).
Please note that they are part of the algorithm described in the paper submitted for review.
It is necessary to install two R libraries *FuzzyNumbers* and *FuzzySimRes* and then evaluate the functions in .R files before their use.
The main function *ImputationDMethod* imputes missing values (NAs) in the given matrix related to fuzzy numbers.
The respective example together with checking the quality of the output can be found in the file *example.R*.
